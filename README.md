# NGS

By using two subsequent rounds of genome editing we have developed the clonal cell line CHO 4BGD with knockouts of two pro-apoptotic genes Bak1 and Bax, knockout of two possible selection markers genes -glul (GS) and dhfr and additional copies of genes bcl-2 and Beclin-1, used for enhancement of macroautophagy induction during the environmental stress.
